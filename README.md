## Transportation-Data-Science-Project

This repository hosts a data analysis project on motor vehicle collisions and traffic safety, **developed through a collaboration between the [Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org/), the [National Student Data Corps](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/), and the [U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/)**.


## Overview

This project explores crash frequency, injury severity, and fatality rates to gain insights into:

- **Which days or times see the highest crash counts**  
- **Possible relationships between traffic patterns and collisions**  
- **Injuries and fatalities by day of the week**  

By investigating these questions, we aim to **highlight key risk factors** and support evidence-based decision making to **improve transportation safety**.

## Repository Contents

1. **Data Preparation Notebooks**  
   Demonstrates how raw crash data is loaded, cleaned, and merged for further analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Analysis Scripts**  
   Python notebooks focusing on descriptive statistics (counts, averages) and basic visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps).  

3. **Time-Series Decomposition**  
   Scripts that analyze seasonal, trend, and residual components of crash data.  

4. **Day-of-Week Analysis**  
   Code that pinpoints which day(s) of the week see the most crashes, injuries, and fatalities.  

5. **Map Visualizations**  
   Folium-based interactive heatmaps to pinpoint hotspots for crashes and their severity on a city map.
